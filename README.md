# OpenTofu Infrastructure Projects

This repository contains a curated set of **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementations** built using **OpenTofu** on **AWS**.  
The projects focus on **correct cloud architecture, security-first design, and operational best practices**, rather than minimal demos.

Each project is designed, implemented, validated, and version-controlled.
